A strategic acquisition in East Maitland's established residential precinct, positioned to capitalise on the Hunter Valley's sustained population growth and infrastructure investment.

The site presented as a single 4,200m² parcel with existing R2 zoning and established services. Initial feasibility identified potential for 12 residential lots ranging from 450m² to 520m², meeting strong demand for entry-level housing in the region.

## Acquisition

Secured off-market through our local network at $1.2M—approximately 15% below comparable sales. The vendor sought a quick settlement, which we accommodated through our established funding structures.

## Development

DA approval was obtained within 14 weeks with no modifications required. Civil works commenced in Q2 2023 and completed ahead of schedule due to favourable weather conditions and contractor performance.

## Sales Outcome

All 12 lots were released simultaneously and sold within 6 weeks. Final average lot price of $400,000 exceeded feasibility projections by 12%, driven by limited competing stock and continued buyer demand in the Maitland LGA.
