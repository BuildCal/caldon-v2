Merton Residences is a boutique development of eight contemporary townhouses, strategically positioned in an established residential precinct of Taree.

The project was conceived to address growing demand for quality, low-maintenance living options in the Manning Valley region. Each townhouse has been thoughtfully designed to maximise natural light and cross-ventilation, with private outdoor spaces and secure parking.

The development incorporates modern architectural principles while respecting the character of the surrounding neighbourhood.
